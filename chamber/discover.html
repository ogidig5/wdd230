      <h2>Nairobi's Central Business District</h2>
      <p>
        Here is an overview of Nairobi Central Business District. Nairobi is the capital of Kenya. It is situated in the
        south-central
        part of the country, in the highlands at an elevation of about 5,500
        feet (1,680 metres). The city lies 300 miles (480 km) northwest of
        Mombasa, Kenya's major port on the Indian Ocean. A very beautiful city.

      <h2>Lake Victoria</h2>
      <p>
        Lake Victoria, also called Victoria Nyanza, is the largest lake in Africa and chief reservoir of the Nile, lying
        mainly
        in Tanzania and Uganda but bordering on Kenya. Its area is 26,828 square miles (69,484 square km). Among the
        freshwater lakes of the world, it is exceeded in size only by Lake Superior in North America. A lot of fishing
        takes place here.

      <h2>Nairobi National Park</h2>
      <p>
        This is the only national park in the entire world located in a city! The park has a large and diverse wildlife
        population. Species found in the park include lion, leopard,
        African buffalo, black rhinoceros, giraffe, hippopotamus, spotted hyena, blue wildebeest, plains zebra, cheetah,
        Thomson's gazelle, Grant's gazelle, common eland, impala, hartebeest, waterbuck, common warthog, olive baboon,
        black-backed jackal, common ostrich, and Nile crocodile. Its amazing!

    <article>
      <h2>The Maasai Tribe of Kenya</h2>
      <p>
        They are among the best known local populations internationally due to their distinctive customs and dress.
        All of the Maasai's needs for food are met
        by their cattle. They eat the meat, drink the milk daily, and drink the blood on occasion. Bulls, goats, and
        lambs are slaughtered for meat on special occasions and for ceremonies. Though the Maasai's entire way of life
        has historically depended on their cattle, more recently with their cattle dwindling, the Maasai have grown
        dependent on food such as sorghum, rice, potatoes and cabbage (known to the Maasai as goat leaves). Interesting,
        right?

    <article>
      <h2>The Sprawling Open Air Market</h2>
      <p>
        This is Gikomba, the largest open-air market in Kenya. It was established in the
        1960s by the colonial government as a market for Africans. It specialises in mitumba (or second hand clothes),
        but also sells fresh fruit, vegetables, meat as well as local baskets and household items. The market is open
        throughout the week but is especially lively on Saturday. Be warned‚Äîbargaining is expected and greatly enjoyed
        by
        the local people.

      <h2>Mount Kenya</h2>
      <p>
        Mount Kenya is the highest mountain in Kenya and the second-highest in Africa, after Kilimanjaro.
        Many tourists climb and hike the mountain because of its beautiful scenary.
        Mount Kenya is the main water catchment area for two large rivers in Kenya; the Tana, the largest river in
        Kenya, and the Ewaso Nyiro North. The Mount Kenya ecosystem provides water directly for over 2 million people.

    <article>
      <h2>Tea Plantation</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a tea plantation. Kenyan tea has a distinct amber brownish colour and what is described as a ‚Äúbrisk‚Äù,
        ‚Äúfull bodied‚Äù flavor. This
        refers to a robust flavor that can stand up well with milk, as tea is often drunk in the UK. Kenyan tea creates
        a richer infusion than poorer quality tea which can leave you with a light or weak cup of tea

    <article>
      <h2>Tuk Tuk</h2>
      <p>
        Together with motorbikes, tuk tuks are the most common and cheapest mode of transport. They have created
        employment to
        many youth in the region. A ride in one is definitely the best feeling. Make a point of riding one when visiting
        the country.

      <h2>Wildlife</h2>
      <p>
        Kenya's geographic diversity means that it supports an extraordinary range of wildlife. The country's premier
        national parks and reserves, a list that includes the Masai Mara, Amboseli, Tsavo East and West, Samburu-Buffalo
        Springs, Meru and Laikipia, are all home to most or all of the Big Five, i.e. lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo
        and Black rhino.
