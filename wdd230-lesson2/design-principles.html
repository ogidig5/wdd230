          Navigation: Use of colors helps with way finding. Logo: The logo has a
          circular shape and an arrow. This pattern is reapeated in the
          website's home page. Graphics: Arrows are repeated on top of the video
          on both the homepage as well as the interior pages. Brand Colors: Grey
          elements with pops of yellow are clearly seen.

        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>

        <p>
          In this website, the user can really see how the rule of thirds has
          been used to draw their attention into the subject matter. Ideally,
          the empty space that's left should be in the direction of the subject
          is looking or heading into. This website best illustrates this design
          principle.

        <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

        <p>
          Hick's law states that the more the stimuli/choices users face, the
          longer it will take them to make a decision. Hick's law acknowledges
          the precious time of the user by categorizing the choice to help users
          locate their options as fast as possible. This is basically obscuring
          complexity. This movie website illustrates just this design concept.
